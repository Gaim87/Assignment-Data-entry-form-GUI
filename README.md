# Assignment-Data-entry-form-GUI

This program is a generic data entry form for UK citizens. It was written using Visual Studio 2019's Windows Forms project template and, as an assignment, it tested our successful application of the principles for effective human-computer interaction and user interface design.

The application performs active, real-time input validation and assists the user in every way I could think of (tooltips, icons, visually, auto-fill, pre-defined values etc.). Besides the above, the form does nothing more and no data is permanent. The usernames "edwin34", "mike1976", "AmandaP" and
"AGFerg" were hard coded, so that the examiners could check the validation process's functionality.

You can build and run the program by opening the .sln file in Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). When you have finished inputting your data, you can press the "Process" button to process and (theoretically) register it.
